        <h1 class="section-title">What is a can?</h1>
        <p>A steel can, tin can, tin (especially in British English, Australian English, Canadian English and South
          African English), steel packaging, or can is a container for the distribution or storage of goods, made of
          thin metal. Many cans require opening by cutting the "end" open; others have removable covers. Cans hold
          diverse contents: food, beverages, oil, chemicals, etc. Steel cans are made of tinplate (tin-coated steel) or
          of tin-free steel. In some dialects, even aluminium cans are called "tin cans".[1]</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The tin canning process was allegedly created by the Frenchman Philippe de Girard, but the idea eventually
          passed to British merchant Peter Durand who was used as an agent to patent Girard's idea in 1810.[2] The
          canning concept was based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers the year before by the
          French inventor Nicholas Appert. Durand did not pursue food canning, but, in 1812, sold his patent to two
          Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product, and set up the world's first
          commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813 they were producing their first tin canned
          goods for the Royal Navy. By 1820, tin canisters or cans were being used for gunpowder, seeds, and turpentine.
        </p>
        <p>Early tin cans were sealed by soldering with a tin-lead alloy, which could lead to lead poisoning.</p>
        <p>In 1901 in the United States, the American Can Company was founded, at the time producing 90% of United
          States tin cans.[3]</p>
